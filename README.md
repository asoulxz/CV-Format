# Simple CV with HTML

This project is a very basic **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** created only with **pure HTML**, without external CSS or frameworks.  
The goal is to practice HTML structure, text formatting, and simple layout techniques.

## 📋 Features

- Simple border around the content using `<table>` or `<fieldset>`.
- Sections for:
  - Personal Information
  - Skills
  - Education
  - Experience
- Use of basic HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<table>`, `<font>`, etc.).
- Colored headings (green for sections, blue for job/education titles).
